The Code Quiz web app is a ten question quiz about HTML,CSS,JavaScript, and BootStrap. The user will be prompt with the rules and when ready, can click start.

Once started, a timer will appear in the top right corner and begin counting down from 90. If the user answers any question wrong, they will lose 15 seconds from the timer. Once the timer reaches 0 or they finish the quiz, the user will be given their score and the chance to log it on the highscores page.
